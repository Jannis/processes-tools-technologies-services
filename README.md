# Processes, Tools, Technologies & Services

An overview of recommended and/or interesting processes, tools,
technologies and third-party services for software projects, each
with a short comment.

## Development Processes

* [Online standups (Slack, IRC, ...)](online-standups.md) -
  as developed by Codethink Ltd. Codethink has been using this process
  sucessfully for years. Having standup minutes written down and logged
  somewhere makes them easy to follow and look up at any time. It also
  works well in large and remote teams. I am still using this process
  in my projects today.
* [Git workflow & code review](git-workflow-and-review.md) - Having a
  master branch that is always release-ready and doing the majority of
  development in feature/topic/user branches is extremely beneficial.
  In combination with well-written Git commit messages and Git's awesome
  rebase feature it also allows to perform code reviews on pull/merge
  requests. Among many other things, code review is a great tool to
  teach/learn, to distribute knowledge in teams, to align everyone on
  coding style and common ways of doing things and to verify changes
  before they are merged.
* [Clojure coding style](https://github.com/bbatsov/clojure-style-guide)
  - a consistent coding style is good. Do I need to say anything else?
