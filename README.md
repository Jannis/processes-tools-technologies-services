# Processes, Tools, Technologies & Services

An overview of recommended and/or interesting processes, tools,
technologies and third-party services for software projects, each
with a short comment.

## Development Processes

* [Online standups (Slack, IRC, ...)](online-standups.md)
  as developed by Codethink Ltd. Codethink has been using this process
  sucessfully for years. Having standup minutes written down and logged
  somewhere makes them easy to follow and look up at any time. It also
  works well in large and remote teams. I am still using this process
  in my projects today.
* [Git workflow & code review](git-workflow-and-review.md)
* [Clojure coding style](https://github.com/bbatsov/clojure-style-guide)
